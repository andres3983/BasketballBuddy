# BasketballBuddy
Project that tracks field goal % and has mini-games, like shots in 30. Shots are tracked by an ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) and are displayed on a LCD displa. Shots are also visually and audibly tracked via a passive buzzer and a LED. Two buttons control the reset and the game browsing features.
