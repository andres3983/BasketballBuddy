# BasketballBuddy
Get more out of your basketbll hoop! BasketballBuddy is a project that tracks field goal % and has mini-games, such as shots made in 30 seconds. Shots are tracked by an ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) and are displayed on a LCD display. Shots are also visually and audibly displayed via a passive buzzer and a LED. Two buttons control the reset and the game browsing features.

✍️Code can be found in the basketball_buddy folder.

⚡️Schematics can be found in the BasketballBuddySchematics and the TinkercadSchematics folders
